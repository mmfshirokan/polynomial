## Task description ##

> Create *Polynomial* class for working with [polynomials](http://www.berkeleycitycollege.edu/wp/wjeh/files/2015/01/algebra_note_polynomial.pdf) of degree `n > 0` of one real variable. Use the *sz*-array (single dimention, zero-based) as an internal structure for storing coefficients.   
> Implement an equivalence protocol by value.   
> Overload basic operations   
>   - addition    
>   - multiplication   
>   - subtraction   
>   - *division (optional)*   
>   - equality and inequality tests.
